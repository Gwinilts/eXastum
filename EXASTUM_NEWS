Hi everyone,
just letting you know that eXastum 5 is now in active development. Code will begin appearing on Github as soon as it is useable 
as I know many of you are users and uploading the existing code will result in too many bug reports so I will upload when I feel 
project is ready for use. I'm extremely busy at the moment as I'm reaching the end of my college degree and have final projects to 
finish. They will be over in 1 week so then eXastum can have all my attention. Thank you for your support and patience.
