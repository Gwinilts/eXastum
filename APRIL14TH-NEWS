Hi everyone,

On April 14th 2011 the first full version of this project, known as eXast 1.4, was released.  
Today marks 5 years since this event and to celebrate I'm announcing several new updates to the project.  
Sadly today I am unable to celebrate the event as I have a very large college assignment to finish but  
I'm sure we'll make up for it next week!  
To celebrate 5 years I will be cleaning up and re-releasing all past versions of the project including the never released early versions.  
The first builds of eXastum V will also begin appearing next week.
I hope you can enjoy these updates and thank you for being a part of the eXastum journey,  
5 years is a long time and we've had a lot of fun with this project.  
Hopefully there are many fun years still ahead.  
Thank you!  

Brian Millar
