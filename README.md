RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
====================

==FIREFOX===========
 Firefox should just run the index.html file with no problems, everything should
 just work.

==CHROME============
 eXastum will only work correctly in Chrome when using a localhost server. You
 MUST use a server or Chrome will block many features based on its security
 model.
